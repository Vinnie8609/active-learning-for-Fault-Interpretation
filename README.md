# active-learning-for-Fault-Interpretation
This project is the code for paper URAL: Uncertainty-driven Region-based Active  Learning for Data-Efficient Fault Interpretation published in  Remote Sens
# Requirements
The main package and version of the python environment are as follows
The above environment is successful when running the code of the project. Pytorch has very good compatibility. Thus, I suggest that try to use the existing pytorch environment firstly.
