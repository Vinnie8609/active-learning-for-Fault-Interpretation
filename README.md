# active-learning-for-Fault-Interpretation
This project is the code for paper URAL: Uncertainty-driven Region-based Active  Learning for Data-Efficient Fault Interpretation published in  Remote Sens
# Requirements
The main package and version of the python environment are as follows
| Name      | Version           |
|-------------------|---------------------|
|python             |       3.8.5         |           
|pytorch            |       1.10.1        |
|torchvision        |       0.11.2        | 
|cudatoolkit        |       10.2.89       |
|cudnn              |       7.6.5         | 
|matplotlib         |       3.3.2         |   
|numpy              |       1.19.2        |
|opencv             |       4.6.0.66      |  
|pandas             |       1.1.3         |    
|scikit-learn       |       0.23.2        |     
|tqdm               |       4.50.2        |


The above environment is successful when running the code of the project. Pytorch has very good compatibility. Thus, I suggest that try to use the existing pytorch environment firstly.
